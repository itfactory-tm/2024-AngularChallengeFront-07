# FritFest 2024-2025 Angular Frontend

**Made by Willem De Bie, Seppe Van Campfort, Jorrit Geurts, Arno Van haecke, Sybren Backx**

## Project Overview
Welcome to the FritFest frontend project! This project is the Angular-based frontend for FritFest, a three-day annual food truck festival. The frontend is designed to provide an engaging and interactive user experience for festival attendees.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: The main framework used for building the frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used throughout the application.
- **Backend Connection**: We use a .NET backend. [See the source code](https://github.com/itfactory-tm/2024-AngularChallengeBack-07).

## Backend Integration
The frontend communicates with a .NET backend that uses Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to manage data. The backend handles all the business logic and data storage for the festival.
